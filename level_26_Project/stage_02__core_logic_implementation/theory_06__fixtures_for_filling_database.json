      "description": "Caramel Malt 60L (also known as Crystal 60L) is a versatile specialty malt that is a secret weapon for many brewers to enhance beer color, flavor, and body. It imparts a beautiful copper-amber hue to the brew.\n\nThe flavor of this malt is characterized by distinct notes of caramel, toffee, and light hints of toasted bread. It adds a pleasant sweetness to the beer that beautifully balances hop bitterness and also contributes to improved head retention.\n\nCaramel Malt 60L is ideal for a wide range of styles, from Pale Ales and Amber Ales to Porters and Stouts, adding complexity and depth.",

Cascade is excellent for both bittering and late kettle additions or for dry hopping.\n\nThis hop is a reliable choice for brewers looking to create a refreshing, balanced, and recognizable ale.",
